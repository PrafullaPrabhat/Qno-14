Scheduling Algorithm
14.	If a teacher is being served at the food mess and during the period when he is being served, another teacher comes, then that teacher would get the service (food) next. This process might continue leading to increase in waiting time of students to get food. Ensure in your program that the waiting time of students is minimized.


Priority scheduling involves priority assignment to every process, and processes with higher priorities are carried out first, whereas tasks with equal priorities are carried out on a first-come-first- served (FCFS) or round robin basis. An example of a general-priority-scheduling algorithm is the shortest-job-first (SJF) algorithm
Priorities can be either dynamic or static. Static priorities are allocated during creation, whereas dynamic priorities are assigned depending on the behavior of the processes while in the system. To illustrate, the scheduler could favor input/output (I/O) intensive tasks, which lets expensive requests to be issued as soon as possible.
